# Components Directory

This directory contains UI components for the AI Shopping Assistant application.

In the standalone version, we primarily use vanilla JavaScript with DOM manipulation.
In the Shopify integration, additional components may be used for the integration.

## Component Structure

- `ChatWidget.js` - Chat widget for AI-powered shopping assistance
- Additional components as needed for the application

Each component should follow these principles:
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use clear, descriptive naming
- Minimize dependencies between components
